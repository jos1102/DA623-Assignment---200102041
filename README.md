Frequency analysis of English phonemes

Hello, my name is Joshith. I am a senior at IIT Guwahati pursuing my Bachelor in Electronics and communication engineering

In this tutorial, we will analyse eight English-language phonemes by plotting time-domain signal, DFT and spectrograms of phonemes.

Phonemes are the most minor sound units in a language that can distinguish one word from another. In English, there are around 44 phonemes, including vowel sounds like "a", "e", "i", "o", "u", and consonant sounds like "p", "b", "t", "d", "k", "g". These phonemes combine to form words and are essential for understanding and producing spoken language.

In this tutorial, we will be looking at /s/, /t/, /v/, /w/, /j/, /e/, /i/, /aI/
